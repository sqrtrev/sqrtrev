# SeungHyun Kim - sqrtrev

I'm currently undergraduate students at [Korea University](https://korea.edu, "Korea University") and play CTFs with [WreckTheLine](https://wrecktheline.com, "Team WreckTheLine") and [Super Guesser](https://ctftime.org/team/130817, "Super Guesser"). Super Guesser is a team that I organized with [sapra](https://twitter.com/pwntheweb, "sapra") from Team OpenToAll.
Anyway, I love to play CTFs and research about web security. If you want more information about me, you can check my [website](https://vuln.live/about, "website").
