# SeungHyun Kim - sqrtrev

I'm currently an undergraduate student at [Korea University](https://korea.edu) and play CTFs with [WreckTheLine](https://wrecktheline.com) and [Super Guesser](https://ctftime.org/team/130817). Super Guesser is a team that I founded with [sapra](https://twitter.com/0xsapra) from Team OpenToAll.
Anyway, I love to play CTFs and research web security. If you want more information about me, you can check my [cv](http://cv.vuln.live).
